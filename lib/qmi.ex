  Qualcomm MSM Interface in Elixir

  This module lets you send and receive messages from a QMI-enabled cellular
  modem.

  To use it, start a `QMI.Supervisor` in the supervision tree of your choosing
  and pass it a name and interface. After that, use the service modules to send
  it messages. For example:

  ```elixir
  # In your application's supervision tree
  children = [
    #... other children ...
    {QMI.Supervisor, ifname: "wwan0", name: MyApp.QMI}
    #... other children ...
  ]

  # Later on
  iex> QMI.WirelessData.start_network_interface(MyApp.QMI, apn: "super")
  :ok

  iex> QMI.NetworkAccess.get_signal_strength(MyApp.QMI)
  {:ok, %{rssi_reports: [%{radio: :lte, rssi: -74}]}}
  ```
