Qualcomm MSM Interface in Elixir

This library lets you send and receive messages from a QMI-enabled cellular
modem. It is intended for use with `vintage_net_qmi` and most users will
want to use `VintageNet` to configure a cellular modem than to use this
library directly.

## Usage

First, start a `QMI.Supervisor` in the supervision tree of your choosing
and pass it a name and interface. After that, use the service modules to send
it messages. For example:

```elixir
# In your application's supervision tree
children = [
  #... other children ...
  {QMI.Supervisor, ifname: "wwan0", name: MyApp.QMI}
  #... other children ...
]

# Later on
iex> QMI.WirelessData.start_network_interface(MyApp.QMI, apn: "super")
:ok

iex> QMI.NetworkAccess.get_signal_strength(MyApp.QMI)
{:ok, %{rssi_reports: [%{radio: :lte, rssi: -74}]}}
```

If you are using Linux you will need to call `QMI.configure_linux/1` before
bring the interface up.
